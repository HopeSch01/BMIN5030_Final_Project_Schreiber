# BMIN5030 Final Project

##Creating and Evaluating Seasonal Influenza Thresholds in Pennsylvania 

The goal of this project is to explore two popular methods for determining intensity thresholds for seasonal in Pennsylvania. The data utilized will be from the CDC’s FluVIew Interactive database [1]. This is an online tool that provides publicly available, weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) data at the state level. The overall purpose of this project is to apply the methods to Penn’s own community, with the help of Sidney P and Kendra T (Epidemiologist and Data Analyst on the Public Health team at Penn Wellness).
